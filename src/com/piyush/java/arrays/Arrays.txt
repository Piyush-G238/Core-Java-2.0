Arrays :
An array is a group of variables of similar data types are referred to by a common name.
A specific element in an array is accessed through its index.

One-dimensional arrays:
syntax for declaring one-dimensional array:

data_type[] ref-var;

For e.g : array of month_days(int)
int month_days[];

Initializing an array:
ref-var = new data_type[size];

E.g:
int month_days[];
month_days = new int[30];

Array initializing and declaring in one stmt:
E.g:
int[] month_days = new int[12];

Multidimensional arrays:
In java, multidimensional arrays are implemented as arrays of arrays.

E.g:
int twoDimensionArr[][] = new int[4][5];
This will allocate an array of size 4x5, to the variable twoDimensionArr.
Internally, this matrix is implemented as 'array of arrays' of 'int'.

Note:
while allocating memory for multidimensional array, you need to specify leftmost dimension.

int twoD[][] = new int[4][]; (this is a valid syntax)
