Constructors:
A constructor initializes object immediately upon creation.It has same name as the class name
Constructor don't have any return type, not even void. This is because the implicit
return type of classâ€™ constructor is the class type itself.

Parameterized Constructor:
Adding parameters to the constructor.

E.g: Box myBox = new Box(10,20,30);

"this" keyword
"this" can be used inside any method to refer any variable to the current object.
"this" is always a reference to the object on which method was invoked.

Garbage Collection:
Garbage collection is technique used by java to handle de-allocation of memory automatically.
when no reference to an object exist, object is assumed to be no longer needed, and memory occupied by the object can be reclaimed.
