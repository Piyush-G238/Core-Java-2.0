Introducing methods:
general form of method:

type "methodName"(parameter-list){
    //body of method
}

1. type specifies return type of the method, if method doesn't return any type, then return type must be mentioned as "void".
2. parameters are essentially variables, that receives value of arguments passed to the method when it is called.
3. If a method is having a return type, then return statement must be there.
