Basically, Java has Eight types of primitive data types:

1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. char
6. float
7. double
8. boolean

Data types according to defined groups :

Integers
1. int : signed 32-bit type. Range : -2147483648 to 2147483647
2. byte : signed 8-bit typed integer. Range : -127 to 128
3. short : signed 16-bit type. Range : -32768 to 32767
4. long : signed 64-bit type.

Note:
1. java doesn't support unsigned/positive only integers.

Floating-point
These are also known as real numbers.
1. float : single precision value, 32-bit type.
Variables of type float are useful when you need a fractional component, but donâ€™t require a large degree of precision.

2. double : double precision value, 64-bit type.
When you need to maintain accuracy over many iterative calculations, or are manipulating large-valued numbers, double is the best
choice.

Characters
1. char : 16-bit type.
Java uses unicode to represent characters. Unicode requires 16 bits.

Boolean
It is a primitive type for logical values. It has two possible values 'true' or 'false'.
