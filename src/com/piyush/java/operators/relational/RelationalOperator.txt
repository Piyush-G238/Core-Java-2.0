Relational Operators:

Relational operators determine relationship that one operand has to the other.
The result of relational operator is always in boolean.

1. == equals to
2. != not equals to
3. >= greater than equal to
4. <= less than equal to
5. > greater than
6. < less than

Logical Operators:
These operators will work only on boolean operands, all binary logical operators combine two boolean values to form resultant boolean value:

1. & logical AND
2. | logical OR
3. ^ logical XOR
4. && short-circuit AND (standard practice to use)
5. || short-circuit OR (standard practice to use)
6. ! logical NOT
7. ?: Ternary if-then-else

A       B       A|B         A&B         A^B         !A
false   false   false       false       false       true
false   true    true        false       true        true
true    false   true        false       true        false
true    true    true        true        false       false

The ternary operator(?)

Syntax:

expression1 ? expression2 : expression3;

if expression1 is true, then expression2 is evaluated otherwise expression3 is evaluated.
