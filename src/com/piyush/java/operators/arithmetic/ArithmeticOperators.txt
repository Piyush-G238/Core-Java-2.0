Operators:

Operators can be divided into following four groups:
1. arithmetic
2. bitwise
3. relational
4. logical

Arithmetic Operators
These operators are generally used in mathematical expressions. List of operators under arithmetic operators
1. + addition
2. - subtraction
3. * multiplication
4. / division
5. % modulus
6. ++ increment
7. -- decrement

Modulus operator:
modulus operator(%) returns remainder of the division operation. It can be applied to both int and double type.
e.g:
10 mod 2 = 0
10 mod 3 = 1

Increment and Decrement
increment operator increases its operand value by 1, whereas decrement operator decreases its operand value by 1.

there are two kinds of increments/decrements:
1. Pre-increment/decrement
2. Post-increment/decrement

Pre increment: First increment, then use
E.g:
int x = 42
int y = ++x (y is set to 43)

Post increment: First use, then increment
E.g:
int x = 42;
int y = x++ (y is set to 42)

Pre decrement: First decrement, then use
E.g:
int x = 42
int y = --x (y is set to 41)

Post decrement: First use, then decrement
E.g:
int x = 42;
int y = x-- (y is set to 42)
