Jumping statements

These statements transfer control to another part of your program.
Jump statements involved with java:
1. break
2. continue
3. return

Break statement:
Break statement has three use cases
1. It is used to terminate loops in between (exit from loop)
2. Use in switch statement.
3. Civilized form of "goto" statement.

Using break as form of goto:
Syntax:
break label;
label is the name of a label that identifies a block of code. To name a block put a "label : " at the start of it.

Continue statement:
A continue statement causes control to be transferred directly to conditional expression that controls the loop.

Return statement:
return statement is used to explicitly return from a method. It causes program control to go back to the caller of method.
